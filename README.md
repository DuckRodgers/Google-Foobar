# Google-Foobar
The snips of codes developed during the Google-Foobar challenge.

## A Little Context
In case you're not familiar with the Google-Foobar challenge, the first question is why are you here? Just kidding. The Foobar is a secret challenge which may precede a recruitment process done by Google. This is their equivalent of a CV reading, except instead of being open, is _super secret_, except for the thousands of git repositories and posts about it you can find online.

Legends says if you pass the third phase you get an interview with someone from Google. If you go through Quora and Reddit this checks out.

If, like me, you aren't from TI as your original academic formation, then you must imagine what an incredible feeling I got when not only I got the invite but decided to google it and find out what it actually meant. So... this are my code snips which I used to pass from the first and second phase. At the moment I'm still completing the challenge, now entering the *Second Level - Second Challenge*, and 100% hyped up about it.
